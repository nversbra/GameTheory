start a python server to run and change the plot script:
terminal -> cd to this folder -> ipython notebook

the files with the results are placed in a folder corresponding to the figure of the paper and the value for the initial fraction of the non-fundamelist population (=rho_G_0).

filename: e.g. 1a_sigmaG7_rhoG2.txt is figure 1a, sigma_G_0 = 0.7 and rho_G_0 = 0.2. If rho_G_0 = 0.0, the plot looks like the one in the paper.
